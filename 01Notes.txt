Number, string, boolean, object, function, Symbol are basic types

undefined and null are special values

0, empty string, undefined, null, and NaN are falsy

For variables, use let. Use const for constants

Constants cannot be reassigned

Uninitialized variables are 'undefined'

Constants must be initialized

Using var for variables, splits the declaration and assignment parts. Declaration is hoisted (to the top) and assignment happens at the line written.

Functions can be written as named functions, function expressions (with function keyword or lambda expressions)

Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. This is the basis of callbacks.

JavaScript has the single threaded execution model, but asynchrony is handled by external APIs. These APIs either create tasks or microtasks. For example, setTimeOut creates a task, while then() method of Promise creates a microtask.

Task >> Stack (synchronous JS lines) >> Microtasks >> Task ... This is the JS event loop.
